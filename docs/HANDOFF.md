# Session Handoff — 2026-07-12 (Slice K5, System stage & closeout — MERGED)

State: `slice-k5-system` merged to `main` locally (not pushed — push on
say-so). **The 11-slice greenfield roadmap
(`2026-07-09-implementation-roadmap.md`) is CLOSED**: A–K all merged;
Slice K's five sub-slices K1–K5 delivered the full atlas (skeleton →
lenses → panels → timeline → system stage). **Slice SH (sim-health
harness) merged to main in parallel mid-K5** and is folded in — see its
section below. Gates at the K5 merge: full dotnet suite green ×3 with
the SH fold-in (goldens untouched — K5 adds no sim behavior, only two
read-only Core queries) · EditMode 14/14 · AtlasSmoke every lens + two
system-stage shots · fresh-eyes whole-branch review ("NOT READY — 2
confirmed bugs", both fixed test-first in one wave) · user eyeball
accepted 2026-07-12 after two waves ("good enough for now") · merge
accepted 2026-07-12. ProjectSettings churn stays uncommitted.

## Slice K5 — the system stage (closed)

Kickoff `2026-07-12-slice-k5-kickoff-prompt.md`; ledger
`2026-07-12-slice-k5-ledger.md` (decisions, the T8 review verdict, two
eyeball waves, the re-learned batch trap). Living diagram republished
(§3 zoom caption, §7 SystemStage row as built, §9 System + Facility
panel rows).

- **Core** (`src/Core/Atlas`): `SystemQuery.At` — the orbit-view read
  model: the hex-tier system (stars, a ring row for EVERY slot, occupied
  orbit rows) computed on demand, never persisted, plus epoch overlays
  ATTACHED to orbits by deterministic type affinity (mine→belt/rock,
  skimmer→gas giant, agri→best biosphere, excavation→wreckage,
  everything else→the port body; port→most-settled body).
  Uncommissioned facilities fold into their construction sites (one
  thing, one mark). Layout angles are a pure fnv hash — no RollChannel.
  `FacilityPanel.Card` — type/family/tier/condition/active
  (≡ MarketEngine.IsActive, zero drift), owner with the corp REGISTRY id
  for panel links (id spaces differ from actor ids — review finding).
- **The fifth LOD band**: `LodBand.System` keys on ABSOLUTE distance
  (5.0, guarded for toy galaxies); `MapFade`/`StageFade` crossfade
  curves fold into every map lens (lanes/glyphs/lattice via the shared
  curves; ports/news/domain/nature/price via new OnZoom hooks;
  `AtlasBillboard` gained `_Tint`, `DomainField` gained `_MapFade`).
  Starfield deliberately never fades.
- **SystemStage** (`unity/Assets/Atlas/SystemStage.cs`): EVERY visible
  system hex renders while the crossfade is live (world-space meshes,
  rebuild keyed on the visible-hex set) — zooming magnifies one until
  it fills the view, no pop-in. Option-A orbit grammar (the
  `236896d9…` artifact): thin #262C3F rings per slot, dashed belts, a
  subtle habitable annulus, star core+halo, moons at the body's rim,
  settled worlds ringed #FFBF4F, layouts scaled to fit inside their hex.
  Vertex colors LINEARIZED (the washed-palette bug). Stage is coplanar
  with the lattice; draw order rides renderQueue. No text on the stage.
- **Same selection, same panels**: stage publishes typed pickables
  (port>facility/site>body priority on ties); star/body →
  **System panel** (NEW — the hex's system info: stars, every orbit,
  overlay links), facility → **Facility card** (NEW), site → Project,
  port → Market+Polity. Tooltip retitles to the hovered orbit thing.
  Selection ring is a screen-constant ~3px stroke.
- **Closeout sweeps**: PoC `unity/Assets/Scripts` remnant deleted;
  every runtime Mesh/Material/Texture2D in Assets/Atlas carries
  HideAndDontSave (the flag carried since K2 — closed).

## Slice SH — the sim-health harness (closed, parallel session)

Merged to main at 2926928, folded into K5 before its merge-out. Spec
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-12-sim-health-harness-design.md`; ledger
`2026-07-12-slice-sh-ledger.md`; doc surface **`docs/SIMHEALTH.md`**.
The probe (`src/Core/Epoch/Health/`): MetricRegistry + MetricsOps,
always-on MoneyRow per phase + MetricRow/polity rows per epoch into
`SimState.Health` (in-memory ONLY, never serialized). Conservation:
entry endowment is the sim's only mint; residual ≈ 1e-8 across 32
histories, frozen by ConservationTests. Sweep runner (`sweep
<experiment.json>`, byte-identical CSVs; `runs/` disposable). REPL
`ehealth`. **The treasury-spiral diagnosis** (its product):
`2026-07-12-debt-diagnosis.md` + dashboard artifact — structural,
universal, conserved; Allocation drains max(Credits, Receipts); the
2×-lender gate kills the credit market at epoch 1–4 (LoanRatePerYear is
currently a dead knob). Fix levers + acceptance criteria in the report.

## Carried / flagged

1. **Monetary equilibrium — the fix slice, kickoff ready** (supersedes
   the K3-era credit-loop flag; SH diagnosed it):
   `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-12-slice-me-kickoff-prompt.md`.
2. **SH deferrals**: expedition purses valued at CURRENT ColonyCost;
   O(events²) snapshot scan (trivial at 40 epochs).
3. **CE carried debt** (CE ledger C17): relay bids until the multi-hop
   trader slice; courier allocation fee-blind; stalled InTransit
   couriers can lock fee+cargo; capital-goods chains anemic.
4. Timeline branch switch-back UI · unbounded keyframe memory (K4).
5. Per-lens readability deep-dives + orbit-view polish (labels stayed
   OFF the stage — a deliberate divergence from the option-A mock;
   revisit if the System panel isn't enough) — backlog.
6. Menu F1–F4 stubs; NEW GALAXY → atlas seed handoff (post-roadmap).
7. SystemQuery runs per visible hex per rebuild (~25–50 at crossfade) —
   fine today; cache per (hex, epoch) if panning ever janks.

## Worktree / environment traps (verified through K5/SH — see the
K4/K5 ledgers' lists)

Gitignored `unity/Packages/manifest.json` / `packages-lock.json` /
`src/Core/csc.rsp` must be copied into fresh worktrees before Unity
batch runs; **batchmode dies in ~2s (exit 1, ~1KB log) while the editor
holds the project — and a trailing `echo exit: $?` masks the failure;
verify log size + output mtimes**; MCP bridge approval is per-project;
goldens are CRLF on disk; PowerShell mangles piped stdin (bash
`printf`); vertex colors need explicit `.linear` in the linear
pipeline; `runs/` is disposable (never keep the only copy of anything
there); the health series is in-memory (step before `ehealth`);
**parallel sessions can move `main` mid-slice — re-check `git log main`
before any merge-out and fold main back in first.**

## Next up

1. **Slice K6 (The economy surfaces)** — the chained kickoff:
   `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-12-slice-k6-kickoff-prompt.md` —
   TRADE lens on the rail, order-book + contracts panels, freight
   purposes on the map, war-supply readout; zero sim behavior.
2. **Slice ME (Monetary equilibrium)** — parallel-safe with K6
   (worktrees): `2026-07-12-slice-me-kickoff-prompt.md`; re-runs the
   committed diagnosis sweep as its acceptance.
3. **The gap-list backlog** — the roadmap's designated successor queue:
   `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-11-design-acceptance.md` (13 filed
   gaps: player verbs, perceived-price trading, sanctions, plague/war/
   fleet depth…), plus the carried flags above.
4. **Multi-hop actor runs** over perceived books (retires relay bids;
   the P3 trader edge) — unscheduled; measurable with the sweep harness.
5. User read-through of the design specs — still outstanding.

## Carried process conventions (unchanged)

Lighter protocol per /CLAUDE.md (scope nod · eyeball · merge decision;
kickoff-prompt chaining); hex-tier suite never breaks; ProjectSettings
stays uncommitted; parallel slices take worktrees (never a shared
checkout); every new `src/Core` file gets a two-line `.meta` with a
fresh guid; the design is the spec — deviations amend `docs/design/`
in-branch, flagged. Unity gates: EditMode suite + AtlasSmoke batch twin
(editor 6000.5.2f1). Tuning conclusions clear the ensemble bar
(SIMHEALTH.md) before landing in TUNING.md.
