# Slice D Ledger — Segments & Markets (slice-d-segments-markets)

Ordered task checklist per the kickoff prompt
(`2026-07-09-slice-d-kickoff-prompt.md`). Updated and committed as tasks
complete — the resumability record. D animates the economy over B's state
model (`src/Core/Epoch/`) and C's catalogs (`src/Core/Substrate/`): the
first slice where goods actually move. Design sources: `economy/markets.md`,
`substrate/market-geography.md`, `polity/population-and-identity.md`,
`economy/assets-and-investment.md`.

Architecture decisions (made at kickoff, flag deviations):

- **Market registry**: one `Market` per port (market id = port id), per-good
  arrays over the 17 `GoodId`s: price, inventory (qty + mean grade),
  last-cleared qty, black-book demand/price. Unsold inventory persists —
  gluts are visible state.
- **Credits are the treasuries**: B's Expansion/DevelopmentPoints stay as
  earmarked budget shares; the income source becomes real (tax + tariffs +
  state facility income), replacing `StubIncomePerPortPerYear`. Polities get
  a `Credits` ledger; conservation from genesis/entry endowments onward.
- **The economy is roll-free**: prices, flows, migration, drift are all
  deterministic functions in fixed iteration order (ports/goods/segments by
  id). No new `RollChannel` expected; if one becomes necessary it appends at
  41.
- **Segments deepen in place**: + CultureId (culture registry seeded one per
  species at genesis), 4-axis ideology distribution, SoL, Wealth. Migration
  creates/merges same-(species,culture) segments at destination ports —
  diasporas fall out of non-blending.
- **Facility→market attachment is derived**, never stored: nearest same-owner
  port servicing the facility hex (tie: lower port id).
- **Manual lane-cut hook**: transient `SeveredLanes` on SimState (debug-only,
  not serialized) + `estep` REPL continuation — the blockade-spike eyeball.
- **Artifact**: config layer v2 (EECO grows), actors v2 (policies + credits
  become real state — serializer comment anticipated this), segments v2;
  new `markets` layer (MARKET/BLACKBOOK/RESERVE/LOAN records) appended at the
  end of the layer list. Golden regenerated deliberately at slice end.

## Tasks

- [x] 0. **Branch + ledger** — branch `slice-d-segments-markets` from main;
      this file.
- [x] 1. **Economy state types + knobs** — `Market` (per-good price/
      inventory/grade/last-cleared/black book), `Culture` registry,
      `PopulationSegment` v2 fields (CultureId, SoL, Ideology[4], Wealth),
      `PolityRecord.Credits` + `Reserves` (stockpile) + `Loan` records,
      `EconomyKnobs` expansion (per-capita band rates, price drift limits,
      initial prices/endowment, labor share, freight/fuel costs, credit
      dials), event types 202+ (FamineStruck, FacilityBuilt, LoanIssued,
      LoanDefaulted, …). Gate: solution green, structural tests.
- [x] 2. **Supply lands** — MarketsPhase production execution: facility →
      market attachment; extraction output with terrain potentials + raw
      grade at the facility hex; processing consumes market inventory via
      recipes (tech-tier stub gates variants); organic baseline; labor share
      of revenue → segments, remainder → owner; condition scales output.
      Gate: unit tests (fixtures over a seeded state).
- [ ] 3. **Demand assembles + price + clearing** — per-segment band demand
      (C profiles × config rates × income budget, embodiment-modulated);
      institutional demand (facility inputs/upkeep, polity procurement);
      priority-order clearing; transaction tax; price drift toward clearing
      (rate-limited, elasticity from band mix); famine/SoL consequences
      written to segments; black-book conversion for prohibited goods
      (GenesisController writes species-derived law codes). Gate: unit tests
      incl. priority order, famine flag, drift bounds.
- [ ] 4. **Freight** — re-export demand term; arbitrage flows over lanes
      within `LaneMath.Capacity` (fleet-capacity stub), fuel + tariff costs,
      legality at both ends; contracts: unmet polity stockpile targets post
      premium contracts freight fulfills; internal logistics: polity moves
      own goods between own ports at cost (endpoints only touch markets).
      Gate: converge/diverge/blockade-spike tests, capacity cap test.
- [ ] 5. **Allocation rework** — real income (tax + tariffs + facility
      income) × budget weights replaces stub income (knob deleted);
      facility siting execution (C `Siting.Score` + local price signal,
      goods bought at market, construction time, `FacilityBuilt`); upkeep
      purchases, condition decay when unmet; stockpile purchases toward
      targets with perishability decay; simple credit (borrow when treasury
      short, service, default event + collateral seizure). Colony valuation
      gains the price signal. Gate: unit tests, conservation test.
- [ ] 6. **Interior rework** — demographics: growth = f(SoL, provisions
      access, embodiment), famine shrink, machine populations grow by fab
      consumption (Machinery + Compute); migration basics along SoL/income
      gradients over lanes (same-polity + refugee variant minimal);
      ideology drift from lived conditions. Gate: unit tests.
- [ ] 7. **Artifact format v2** — config v2 (EECO grows), actors v2
      (PolityPolicies + Credits serialized), segments v2, new `markets`
      layer (MARKET/BLACKBOOK/RESERVE/LOAN + CULTURE records). Gates:
      byte-identity, load-vs-rebuild equivalence, version refusal,
      round-trip of typed payloads.
- [ ] 8. **REPL surface** — `market <portId>` dump (per-good
      price/qty/grade + black book + segments with SoL/income);
      `emap price [good]` layer; `lanecut <portA> <portB>` debug hook;
      `estep [n]` continuation; help text. Gate: piped-stdin smoke via bash
      printf.
- [ ] 9. **Shape acceptance + full gates** — 40-epoch runs across seeds:
      prices bounded (no NaN/runaway spirals), populations bounded, credits
      conserved; hex-tier suite untouched; full `dotnet test` green.
- [ ] 10. **Fresh-eyes whole-branch review** subagent + one fix wave.
- [ ] 11. **USER: REPL eyeball** — the taste gate: run a sim, `market` a
      hub, `lanecut` a lane, `estep`, watch the spike at the strangled port
      and the glut at the producer. Tune knobs as directed.
- [ ] 12. **Golden freeze + wrap-up** — regenerate
      `Goldens/slice-b-artifact-seed42.txt` successor in the same commit as
      the final format · merge on user nod · HANDOFF · **write Slice E
      kickoff prompt** · flip kickoff checkbox · push only on user say-so.

## Notes / surprises

- **Bootstrap problem** (task 2): construction costs real goods only
  facilities produce — a cold-start deadlock. Resolution: homeworld entry
  seeds a starter industry (AgriComplex, Mine, Skimmer, Refinery, Foundry,
  tier 1, extraction ids before processing so the chain flows in one step)
  plus the one-time credit endowment (`InitialCreditsPerPolity`, the only
  mint). Genesis furniture — no FacilityBuilt events. **Flag at eyeball.**
- Facility→market attachment simplified to *nearest same-owner port* (tie:
  lower id) — the servicing check was redundant in practice.
- Organic baseline moved from task 2 (supply) to task 3 (demand): it is
  self-supply that offsets subsistence demand, not sellable inventory.
- Automation stays 0 in the labor factor until Compute-driven automation
  gets a consumer story (G); machinery grade defaults to the neutral 0.5
  when a market holds none.
- Golden regenerated twice so far (EECO knob line; starter industry) —
  deliberate, same-commit, history changes are the slice's point.
